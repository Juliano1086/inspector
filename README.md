# Process Inspector â€“ Threat Hunting Tool (Windows)

This is a lightweight Python script designed to assist threat hunters and cybersecurity analysts in identifying suspicious processes running on a Windows system.

It scans all active processes and alerts the user if any of them match known malicious names, suspicious file extensions (e.g., `.bat`, `.vbs`, `.ps1`), or are running from unusual directories.
